## Welcome to the Ravenous Project

This project's main focus is to practice and showcase using Javascript + React components. 
  
#### In total, there are four parts to this project:

- Creating Static Components
- Passing Information to Components
- Setting the State of Ravenous Components
- Interacting with the Yelp API

#### Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

- A user should be able to search for restaurants
- A user should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
- A user should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

#### Creating Static Components:

- Used create-react-app to start the project
- Built all of the components for the remainder of the project
- Simulated what Ravenous should look like after returning search results

So far, I have hard coded business information and rendered it manually. In the next steps I focused on how information (like business information) can pass from component to component with less hard coding.

#### Passing Information to Components:
- Moved business information to the container component (App.js)
- Passed information from parent components (App.js) to child components (BusinessList.js, Business.js)

#### Setting the State of Ravenous Components:
- Set the state of search bar elements
- Simulated a search query

#### Interacting with the Yelp API
- Connected to the Yelp API;
- Tested a functionality of the website.
